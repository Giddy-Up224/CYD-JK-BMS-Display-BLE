# CYD-JK-BMS-Display-BLE

тЪая╕ПЁЯЪз Work in progress. Use at your own risk!

This project is a modified version of [peff74/Arduino-jk-bms](https://github.com/peff74/Arduino-jk-bms), rewritten for [CYD](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display) *Thanks to @peff74, FINALLY a solution that actually works out of the box!*

Works with my JK-B1A8S10P
